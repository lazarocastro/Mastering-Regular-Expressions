Hi build admins,

I=E2=80=99d like to add a sitemap for project-specific Javadocs (Flink, =
in this case), to help improve search results.

The http://ci.apache.org/robots.txt file would need to reference a =
shared sitemap index file, where we could add an entry to a project =
specific sitemap.

I=E2=80=99m assuming this isn=E2=80=99t something a project could do via =
self-service, right?

Thanks,

=E2=80=94 Ken

Hi Ken,

No problem at all.

I=E2=80=99ll take a look at adding a sitemap-index.xml to our puppet/git =
setup and anyone can raise PRs to add their sitemap entry there.

Will let you know when its ready.

Gav=E2=80=A6

Service(s) affected: ns2.osuosl.org ns2.auth.osuosl.org

During this time, the DNS and DHCP services on this host will be offline.

Outage Window:
Start:   Mon, June 11, 10:00AM PDT (Mon June 11 1500 UTC)
End:    Mon, June 11, 11:00AM PDT (Mon June 11 1600 UTC)

Reason for outage

=E2=80=8BThe hardware which currently hosts ns2.osuosl.org has been unstabl=
e and
we're going to be migrating this service to a different machine.=E2=80=8B W=
e're
going to attempt simply moving the hard drives from this machine to the new
machine since it's the same type of machine. If this works then the outage
should be fairly short (under 10 minutes).

Our backup plan is to put the drives back into the original machine and do
a clean install and deployment on the newer system. I will send an email to
the list if we end up going with that option which will also extend the
outage window by at least an additional hour.

If you want to reduce the effects of this outage, you can add the following
to your /etc/resolv.conf (assuming your system is new enough):

options rotate timeout:2

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks!

Ok Ken and anyone else interested.

I have updated the robots.txt [1] file to point to a sitemap-index.xml =
[2] file.

So, all you now need to do is ensure you have  a flink.xml.gz sitemap in =
ci.apache.org/projects/flink <http://ci.apache.org/projects/flink>=20
and create a PR against our sitemap-index.xml file, and done, hopefully.

Hi build admins,

[Following up - let me know if there=E2=80=99s some other list I should =
send this to, thanks!]


I=E2=80=99d like to add a sitemap for project-specific Javadocs (Flink, =
in this case), to help improve search results.

The http://ci.apache.org/robots.txt <http://ci.apache.org/robots.txt> =
file would need to reference a shared sitemap index file, where we could =
add an entry to a project specific sitemap.

I=E2=80=99m assuming this isn=E2=80=99t something a project could do via =
self-service, right?

Thanks,

=E2=80=94 Ken

All,

At approximately 2:36AM PDT (0900 UTC), one of the hypervisors (gprod1) in
our primary Ganeti cluster started having hardware issues. This took down
all of the instances running on that node. I attempted to bring the node
back online however the hardware issue prevented it to come back online. At
that point I failed all of the VM instances over to their secondary nodes
and forced another node to become the Ganeti master (since gprod1 WAS the
master). All of the instances were back online by around 7:40AM PDT (1400
UTC).

Everything at this point seems to be back to normal (except for gprod1). I
will look into bringing gprod1 back online later today.

Thank you and sorry for the outages this caused.

Service(s) affected: ftp.osuosl.org

During the outage, the master syncing node for our FTP cluster (ftp-osl)
will be offline which means any updates to our software mirrors will be
delayed.

Outage Window:
Start: Mon, Jun 18 9:30AM PDT (Mon Jun 18 1630 UTC)
End: Mon, Jun 18 3:00PM PDT (Mon Jun 18 2200 UTC)

Reason for outage:

Our FTP cluster is starting to run low on disk space and we will be adding
additional hard drives to the system. Our system currently has 9.375T of
disk space and we're planning on upgrading it to 18.75T (this takes into
account the RAID6 configuration)

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the how the disk arrays are configured,
we will not be able to grow the RAID array without a complete rebuild. This
means we're going to have to re-copy all 8.8TB of data off of the machine
and back onto it. Since this task is rather large and time consuming we've
come up with a better alternative so that we don't have our master FTP
server offline for very long.

We have just recently built a new Ceph cluster for some new storage needs
at the OSL and we are going to temporarily use this cluster to serve the
ftp-osl content. I've already copied the content onto a new volume and have
tested it enough to feel it can handle the load. This should make the
transition plan much easier and quicker than initially.This server is
already out of DNS rotation and we are planning on keeping it out of
rotation until this process is complete to reduce the I/O load.

So here's the plan thus far starting on Monday:

1. Stopping all services on the system and doing one final rsync to the
Ceph volume
2. Rebooting machine and destroying the current RAID and creating a new one
with the new disks
3. Reinstall the OS
4. Bootstrap machine without FTP components initially, setup ceph volume
5. Deploy FTP components after Ceph volume is setup and ready to go
6. Ensure inter FTP node syncing is working using the Ceph volume
7. Sync data from Ceph volume back over to local disks (I'm guessing this
will take 18-24 hours)
8. Once sync is complete, shutdown all services and switch the mount point
over to the local disks
9. Profit!

I would like to thank IBM for donating the hard drives needed for this
upgrade.

We will plan on doing the storage upgrades on our two other nodes (ftp-nyc
& ftp-chi) soon, however we won't be using the Ceph cluster for this since
they are remote. The current plan is to take one machine out for several
days and sync the data back between the nodes. I will send another outage
announcement for those two nodes once we're ready for that. We still need
to ship the drives to the locations and work with the local data centers to
get them installed.

Projects affected: Any project using our FTP cluster as a master syncing
point

I had a few questions regarding this outages that I wanted to clarify for
everyone.

1. There should be no outage during the 5.5 hour outage window for anything
pointed to ftp.osuosl.org (unless your DNS is directly pointing at
ftp-osl.osuosl.org)
2. During the 18-24hr sync from ceph to local storage, ftp-osl should have
normal read/write operations. There might be a little bit of I/O
performance hit during that window but it's hard to tell. There will be a
short (likely 5 min) outage to read/writes on ftp-osl when I do the final
switch back to local storage however.

Hey Rajiv,
Looks like 900,908,930 are down.  0 and 8 have been down for a while
(they might be dead like 7 so should we remove them from Jenkins?) and
I just tried to reboot 30 since it was wedged in a weird state but
hasn't come back up.  If you get a chance to look or verify they are
dead that'd be great.

Thanks!

I just wanted to send you all an update on where we're at in the process.

As of right now, ftp-osl is back online and serving it's content from the
the Ceph volume. I've gone ahead and kicked off a few manual syncs to catch
everything up however if you're using us as a master I recommend you kick
off an update job right now. I'm also currently copying the content to the
local disks which I expect to run through tomorrow sometime.

The rebuild took a little bit longer than originally planned due to some
issues I ran into building the new RAID array. My original plan didn't work
so I had to go with plan B which took a little longer. Plan B resulted in
creating two separate RAID6 arrays which means I lost about 2T in capacity
from my original plan.

I'm keeping ftp-osl out of the public rotation for now since it's I/O
throughput isn't likely as good as before since it's serving the content
via Ceph.

I'll send another update tomorrow when I'm ready to switch back over to
local storage. Please let me know if you notice any issues.

Thanks-

It's taking longer than I expected to sync the data back to the local
disks. This is due to the fact that the system is also rebuilding two RAID6
arrays which I forgot to account for. This is also making the system more
slower than I expected. At this rate it might take a few days to copy all
of the data back. Hopefully once the RAID6 arrays have finished rebuilding,
the I/O rate will speed up the syncing. Both arrays are currently at 55%
and 47% and we've transferred over 993G of 8.8T of data to the local disks.

I will send another update once I'm ready switch the system back over.

Thanks-

Hi there,
at Syncope we have just enabled - thanks to Gavin's support - the deploy to DockerHub via Jenkins (jobs [1][2]) - see [3]; the point is that the 3 Docker images cannot be simply built from their respective Dockerfiles, but need to be generated as part of the Maven build.

Now that SNAPSHOTs are covered by [1] and [2], I was wondering how it would be possible to push releases to DockerHub: I thought that we could create an additional job on Jenkins, which we will manually run at end of our release process [4]; such job will run on the GIT tag of the release.

Gavin suggested to ask here for discussion, so here I am.
WDYT?

Regards.

The sync has been completed and I will be switching this over to the local
drives at 1:30PM PDT (2030 UTC) today. I'm going to also reboot the machine
so that it's running back on the normal CentOS kernel instead of our custom
mainline kernel we needed for Ceph. This outage should only last for about
10 minutes while the machine reboots.

This does not affect anything pointed at ftp.osuosl.org, only ftp-osl
(which is out of rotation).

Thanks-

Interesting. Previously, I was told we were not allowed to push snapshot bu=
ilds
to anywhere that the public might have access - only for our development te=
ams.

If we are now allowed to publish snapshot/nightly/checkin-based images to
DockerHub, that eases a lot of CouchDB's pain.

As far as running a manual job, that works, or you could potentially use th=
e
Promoted Builds plugin. (We don't use that, but I've used it in the past to
promote builds for release in a CI/CD setup.)

In our case, we have to build by checking out (from git) a specific tagged
revision. The build process detects that it was checked out from a tag, and
adjusts the in-built version number to display that it is a real release,
instead of a snapshot build. Because of this, it would make more sense for
us to use a manually triggered build that takes a parameter, using the
Build With Parameters Jenkins plugin. We could then use this to force
checkout from the specific tag.

Subject: [DISCUSS] Deploy releases to DockerHub

Hi there,
at Syncope we have just enabled - thanks to Gavin's support - the deploy to=
 DockerHub via Jenkins (jobs [1][2]) - see [3]; the point is that the 3 Doc=
ker images cannot be simply built from their respective Dockerfiles, but ne=
ed to be generated as part of the Maven build.

Now that SNAPSHOTs are covered by [1] and [2], I was wondering how it would=
 be possible to push releases to DockerHub: I thought that we could create =
an additional job on Jenkins, which we will manually run at end of our rele=
ase process [4]; such job will run on the GIT tag of the release.

Gavin suggested to ask here for discussion, so here I am.
WDYT?

Regards.

I know you were told not to push snapshots to Bintray so as to not abuse
their kindness
and bandwidth as they are donating their services to us.

Snapshots in general should not advertised to the general public. They
should also be marked
clearly as development only and not actual approved releases etc etc.
Linking to the
snapshots should be done on dev mailing lists and in dev areas of the
websites, and not
linked to from the official download pages.
A good example (hosted on our own hardware is
https://ci.apache.org/projects/subversion/nightlies/index.html which
clearly states NOT for
distribution.

As for what 3rd party services can host our unofficial snapshots and
releases the answer is
'it depends'. Is it a service that has been donated? Or are we paying for
the service and
therefore can expect more from them in terms of bandwidth and features and
can we
reliably notify users of their non official status.

I see you have lots of tags there already, but stopped some months ago. I
am unsure
if you were told specifically to not use dockerhub but for now at least, I
do not see
an issue with your resuming this - And best of all you already have a
disclaimer there.

All,

We had an unplanned outage with one of the hypervisors (openpower1) this
evening. I was able to bring the machine back online and it appears all of
the VMs running on it are back online. My initial review of the logs seem
to point to a potential hardware issue. I will look into this more tomorrow
but I wanted to let everyone know what happened in case you noticed.

Thanks-

Hi All,

This is to advise that Jenkins will be going offline for a main instance
and plugins upgrade this coming Sunday. I'll start around 9am UTC and
allowing for plugin updates before and after
the main instance upgrade may the service down for 3 hours or so.

Thanks

Gav...

Subject: JDK 11 tool on Jenkins
To: builds@apache.org
Cc: dev@camel.apache.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Hi,
is there a chance we can get the JDK 11 early access builds tools
defined on Jenkins?

I saw from the Maven Jenkins pipeline scripts[1] that there might be a
`JDK 11 b8 (early access build)`, but that doesn't seem to work when
we try it for Camel[2].

Any chance on getting a `JDK 11 (latest)` tool definition like we have
for 1.8-10?

Should I raise an INFRA issue for that?

Looks like you are configured for your build to look for b19 which we have
not

All,

It seems as though we had some kind of a power event at approximately
6:21AM PDT (13:21 UTC). that affected some (but not all)  of our hosts. At
this point I'm not entirely sure what happened but my guess that one of the
power circuits went down and then came back online. This is confusing since
the UPS should have prevented that. I'm going to be heading into the
datacenter soon to do a visual inspection.

If you have any hosts that are offline and need me to help bring them back,
please send an email to support@osuosl.org and I will take a look. Feel
free to also reach out on IRC at #osuosl.

Thanks-
